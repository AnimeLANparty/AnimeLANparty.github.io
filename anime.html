                        Honestly, there are so many things I could answer this question with. This is because just like many other forms of media, anime isn't really a genre, but rather the form of storytelling itself. This means that there is an anime for almost every person regardless of their interests outside the scope of anime itself. Below are some of my favorites from each genre.
                    </p>
                    <p class="dark">
                        For musical animes, one of my favorite series is Love Live! It was the first show that really got me into anime and aside from the nostalgia, I feel that it stands as a good show on its own. It actually came the Love Live! music videos, and the series was supposed to be the complementary project. However, I believe it to be the shining star. Furthermore, the narrative shift from Love Live! SIP and Love Live! Sunshine is one that I applaud the writers for choosing.

                    <p class="dark">
                        For romcom animes, my favorite, and probably my only favorite, is Kaguya-Sama. This show needs no introduction, you already know what it is. I don't have to justify it, but I would like to add that one of my elements of the show is how self-aware it gets a lot of times. It understands the tropes that most romcoms in general tend to follow, and not only does it premise itself clown on it, but this also means that the way the show progress is not like how your traditional romcom does. When the characters are exaggerated, they are done so for comedic effects, but there are also a lot of human elements to them as well. I cannot applaud them enough.
                    </p>
                    <p class="dark">
                        For slice of life animes, my favorite is Non-Non Biyori. Yeah, I know I already mentioned them before, but it's such as good show because it's so peaceful. The conflict is mild and things tend to resolve themselves quickly. While many might not think this is a negative, I believe that they are perfect for the type of show that Non-Non Biyori is trying to be, which a relaxing show. However, contrary to what many people might believe, there is a mild plot throughout the show. I won't spoil it, but by Season 3, the emotions will be too much to handle. I cannot applaud the creators enough.
