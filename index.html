                    <h3>Slice of Life</h3>
                    <p>Do you enjoy life? Then these shows are for you. "Slice of Life" refers to a genre that depicts a character's daily life. Many people consider these shows boring and slow-paced. While it is easy for a slice of life show to be slow-paced, if done right, they can be relaxing and evoke feelings of nostalgia. Take the show Non-Non Biyori. Many of the characters in that show aren't relatable to me. My life is nothing like there's. Yet, I feel nostalgic from watching their childhood, a childhood that I now realize supersecedes many cultural bounds.</p>

                    <h3>Isekai</h3>
                    <p>Do you hate life? Then these shows are for you. "Isekai" refers to a genre that depicts a character being sent to a fantasy, usually away from their usual boring world. What a strange concept this is, and yet, it somehow kinda works. Take Re-Zero for instance, a classic isekai anime. To the usual viewer, seeing this concept would be wild, but yet, it really works. One of the main reasons why is that the juxtaposition between a regular guy and some fantasy crazy world. There's probably some deep metaphorical analogy there, but I'm not doing to get into it.</p>

                    <h3>Visual Novels</h3>
                    <p> I do not respect you if you pay for these. You are spending money to basically read anime. Why? Why would you voluntary get up, go to your local Barnes & Noble, pick up a light novel from your favorite show (rather than watching the show with the Crunchyroll account you paid for you weeb), and hand over your money to the cashier with a smile on your face? If you do this, I do not respect you. You are the reason why the national grade levels are going down. You are the reason why soap has labels. You are the guy who puts a ruler under his pillow to see how long he slept. You are the guy who thinks 1/4 is larger than 1/3.</p>
