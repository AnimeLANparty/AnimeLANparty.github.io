                            <p>Bro, I already said that I don't like light novels, why would you think that I like manga?</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Why</h3>
                            <p>Manga is just anime but printed. Why would I choose to go out and buy a book from Barnes & Nobles instead of watching the anime it's based off of? Surely, people don't actually want to give money for a downgrade, right? This is clearly Big Book&copy lobbying to take our tax dollars and fund Language classes. Well, I have you know, I am already proficcient at reeding and righting at a midle skool level, tank u veeery mulch. And don't tell me that "oH fOR mAnY sHowS tHe MaNGa InSPirEd tHe ShOWw!111!1!1" What people who make arguments like this fail to realize that it doesn't matter which version came first, but rather which version does a better job of serving as a storytelling medium. As Ghandi once said, there is a reason why the white side of a chess doesn't always win. Quit this coping and realize that anime will forever be the superior form of anime-styled cartoons. I won't even review the manga based off the shows I just mentioned, I don't care if they have narrative shift in anyway. I will refuse to support this villanous and predatory market. End of story.</p>

                            <h3>Theodore Gray's The Elements: A Visual Exploration of Every Known Atom in the Universe</h3>
                            <p>Probably one of the best plots to a manga that I have ever seen. The character variety is so vast it's hard to keep count. The lore being it is so deep and intricate that many people today are still discussing it. And unlike many other mangas out there, this one comes in rich colors that are very eye-catching. Honestly, I don't even know why I'm bringing this masterpiece of narrative storytelling up like you haven't heard of it before. Yeah, you probaby heard references from this manga before in all sorts of different media, but probably haven't even recognized it. It was reference a lot in the hit show Rick and Morty, you probably heard jokes about it in your uni class, and you probably seem someone wearing merch from this franchise. In short, a resounding classic, I applaud the author.</p>
